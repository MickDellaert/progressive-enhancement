        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse
            came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q
                    class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q>
            and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came
            around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
            the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <q
                    class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
                tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong>
                — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
                the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are
            <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for
            bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
